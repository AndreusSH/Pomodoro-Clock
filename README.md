# Pomodoro-Clock
This was a challenge for the advanced Frontend Web Development Javascript in Freecodecamp


You should create a clock for focusing on your study following the pomodoro "technique".
After 25 minutes study, it automatically starts a 5 minutes break.
After you start the clock, you can stop it and reset it!
